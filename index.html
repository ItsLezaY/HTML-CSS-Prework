        <h1>A little About Me</h1>
        <p class="about-me">My name is Leza and I currently reside in Chicago with my two huskies, Ace and Bellamy. As much as I love Chicago, I'll be moving to Florida 
            soon to live with my fiance. I love to play video games, read, strength train, and travel. Behind my extroverted shell, I am at heart an 
            absolute homebody. I'm at my happiest curled up on the couch with a great book, some anime playing in the background, or on discord chatting with friends while we game. 
            My favorite foods include Indian, sushi, and pizza. I am very spiritual and love learning about different people, cultures, history, and metaphysical philosophies. 
            Life is beautiful so let's be kind and radiate positivity!

        <h1>Why Software Engineering?</h1>
        <p class="about-me">Ever since I was a young girl, I could remember watching my brother play video games and feeling
            so intrigued and sucked into the storylines, graphics, and art of it all. And as soon as I was allowed to, I picked them up myself
            and never looked back. As time went on, I dove into online gaming and that's what led me to fall in love with an MMORPG called Final Fantasy XI at the age of 13. 
            I went on adventures, met great people, and most of all.. it opened up a new genre of games I never knew existed before. 
            Years went by, countless games played, and yet nothing ever came close to my love for the game that got me hooked. So a few years ago,
            I learned that there are private server versions of that game which allowed players to enjoy it at an era they knew and loved. I decided to give it a try and even
            volunteered my time to be a part of the staff running it. During that time, I got to look at the code as a GM (Game Master) trying to resolve player tickets.
            The more I looked at the code and started to understand the resolutions to the issues at hand, the more excited I got to learn even more. I started teaching
            myself using online resources available to me such as codeacademy, codefinity, and even spoke to a few developers I befriended to help me debug issues I'd run 
            into as a GM. It's been a blast on my own and now I am excited to take a more structured process in my learning journey with Coding Temple!</p>
